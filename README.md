# Arduino-clap-activated-lamp

In this project a arduino based clap activated lamp is created. 

Parts used:

- Microphone
- Relay
- Arduino UNO R3
- Lamp with led bulb

Microphone sensitivity is set with the potentiometer on the module, so when you clap a specific threshold is reached. 
Then a signal is sent to the relay making it normaly open or closed - light on/light off.
